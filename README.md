HackBio is a 5-weeks virtual research internship that is practice oriented and focused on equipping scientists globally with advanced bioinformatics and computational biology skills.
Detail: https://thehackbio.com/internship

## 🎮 The Stage 0 Task

1. Each team should create a GitHub repo.
2. Add a comprehensive readme.md with essential information about the internship, the team, the contributors, pictures if possible using markdown.
3. Each team will work on a minimum of 7 different programming languages
4. For each person in a team, pick one of the 7 programming languages. Write a script that prints your name, your email, your slack username (with @) , your biostack, your twitter handle and hamming distance in that order. The output for every team member should now be name, email, slack_username (with @) your biostack , twitter_handle and hamming_distance .
5. Push the script to your team's git repo
6. Collaboratively as a team, develop a bash script that clones the git repo, and generates a CSV file from all the outputs of your team's scripts
7. Submit your team's GitHub link to only the bash script
8. Only the emails and slack handles that are on the CSV sheet generated by your script will be promoted to stage 1

## 🛡 Dependencies
```
sudo apt-get -y install parallel r-base python3.6 g++ gcc perl ruby openjdk-8-jre openjdk-8-jdk-headless
```

## 💡 Installation
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nahid18/lander/main/TeamLanderCSV.sh > TeamLanderCSV.sh && bash TeamLanderCSV.sh
```

## 📙 Information Template

```markdown
Name: <your-name-here>
Email: <your-email-here>
Slack Username: <slack-username>
Biostack: <your-hackbio-biostack>
Twitter Handle: <your-twitter-handle>
Hamming Distance: <hamming-distance>
```
**Example:**
```markdown
Name: Abdullah Al Nahid
Email: nahidpatwary1@gmail.com
Slack Username: @abdnahid_
Biostack: Genomics
Twitter Handle: @abdnahid_
Hamming Distance: 0
```
## 🚀 Get Started
1. Open a github account: https://github.com
2. Go to the team github repo (https://github.com/nahid18/lander) and fork it to your account (There's a fork button in top right corner)
3. Create an account at https://replit.com for online code practice
4. Create a project in replit.com with your choice of programming language i.e., python/R/C/C++/Go/Ruby
5. Once you create a project with a programming language, go to google and search how to print text in your selected programming language
6. Then practice it in https://replit.com and check if it prints out the desired information about you
7. Once the final code is ready, download the file, then rename it like this: stage_0_<your_short_name>.<file-extension>
8. Then go to your forked repository that you have done in step 2
9. Upload your just downloaded and renamed file in your github repository
10. Make a pull request to the team repository (https://github.com/nahid18/lander)
